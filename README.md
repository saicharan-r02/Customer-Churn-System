## 🎯 Problem Statement

Customer churn is one of the most costly problems in the telecom industry. Acquiring a new customer costs **5–7× more** than retaining an existing one. Yet most companies only act after a customer has already left.

This project solves two problems in one system:
1. **Predict** — which customers are at risk of churning (and by how much)
2. **Retain** — give a personalised, specific action plan for each at-risk customer *before* they leave

---

## 💡 Solution

A machine learning system trained on **7,032 real Telco customer records** that:
- Classifies each customer into Low / Medium / High churn risk
- Explains *why* that specific customer is at risk
- Recommends personalised retention actions (contract offers, discounts, bundles, loyalty programmes)
- Deployed as a live interactive web application

## 🏆 Model Results

| Model | Accuracy | ROC-AUC |
|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | 79.3% | 0.830 |
| **Random Forest** ✅ | **80.4%** | **0.850** |
| Gradient Boosting | 80.1% | 0.845 |

**Winner: Random Forest** — best accuracy and AUC, selected for deployment.

## 📊 Key EDA Insights (from 7,032 customer records)

| Finding | Data |
|---|---|
| Month-to-month contract churn rate | **43%** vs 3% for 2-year contracts |
| Customers who churn in first 12 months | **68%** — critical early retention window |
| Fiber optic vs DSL churn rate | Fiber churns **2× more** than DSL |
| Highest-risk payment method | **Electronic check** — highest churn of all methods |

---

## 🧠 Retention Intelligence Logic

The system goes beyond a simple probability score. For each customer it analyses:

- **Contract type** → offers specific upgrade discount (15% for 1-yr, 25% for 2-yr)
- **Internet service** → recommends free security/tech bundle for fiber optic users
- **Payment method** → suggests auto-pay switch with 5% monthly discount
- **Tenure** → triggers early loyalty programme for customers under 12 months
- **Monthly charges** → calculates exact saving and proposes price reduction
- **Senior citizens** → recommends dedicated support plan
- **Missing services** → offers targeted streaming/security trial bundles

## 📈 Dataset

- **Source**: IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset (available on Kaggle)
- **Records**: 7,043 customers → 7,032 after cleaning (11 rows with null TotalCharges dropped)
- **Features**: 20 columns including demographics, services, contract, and charges
- **Target**: Churn (Yes/No) → encoded as 1/0

---

## 🔍 Notebook Sections

The training notebook (`Customer_Churn_Project.ipynb`) covers:

1. Data loading & initial exploration
2. Data cleaning (TotalCharges fix, null handling, encoding)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis — 12 plots across demographics and services
4. Feature preprocessing (LabelEncoder + get_dummies + StandardScaler)
5. Model building & comparison (LR vs RF vs GB)
6. ROC curve comparison + feature importance plot
7. Final results — confusion matrix + classification report
